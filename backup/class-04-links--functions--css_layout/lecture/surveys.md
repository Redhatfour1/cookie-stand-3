# WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
* Reading through the code during code review.
* I had trouble setting up my terminal to atom (I use windows) so I felt like it was slowing me down a little bit when instructor was doing class lectures that I would like to have followed along to
* As a complete beginner, I would like to see more direction in the labs at least in the first couple of weeks. I didn't know what user story meant and figuring out the rubric of the lab assignments were a little confusing. I get that we are supposed to just try on our own, but I think I need some hand-holding to get more comfortable. I know that's not the intent, but it's what I need.
* I guess some of the really basic stuff, introduction to command line, git, etc...
* The explanations of Git, GitHub, and Terminal were the most helpful this week. I did not understand those things prior to the start of the class but think that I am progressing well with my understanding. I struggled with getting my linter to work and other issues, but I think that I understand the overall concepts. I think now that those issues are resolved, I will have an easier time next week.
* None - though I did the pre work the reviews have been helpful to ensure I'm understanding the information correctly. You can never drill something into someone's head too many times.

* There were no aspects that weren't helpful, just alot of information being thrown at you at once the first few days.
* Everything about the course so far has been very helpful
* I found everything helpful.
* Nothing was least helpful.



# WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
* Code reviews and lab time. I'm really impressed by everyone's eagerness to work together to achieve a common goal and provide constructive feedback to one another in a respectful way. I've never felt more comfortable in a classroom setting before.
* Bonding with other students at lunch during the Saturday class :)
* I found our co work labs the most helpful. It gave me a chance to connect with the other students in the class and work on problems we were having together.
* 1) Getting the hang of GIT Hub 2) Code Review 3) Lectures
* Working on labs and getting assistance from Lee. The guy knows his stuff!
* The most helpful aspect was learning the git workflow and also working within the terminal. I love knowing that we can control our machines in more ways than one
* TA's and how the instructor gave us a little leeway to catch up and turn in assignments. Lab time was great as well to catch up on assignments.
* Learning about conventions, best practices, "pro tips". CSS was completely new to me, so that was good to get practice with it. Stretch goals! And of course doing the labs.
* The first day was very helpful.
* The lectures.


# DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?
* The course is currently very slow; I'm not learning much.
* I have lots of questions and I'm overwhelmed. This coding class fascinates me, but I'm slow and a new beginner. This bootcamp style platform is intimidating and my concern is keeping up and not being able to contribute much in partner and group exercises.
* Not at this point.
* Nothing as of right now.
* Not right now.
* Not at this time.
* Not at the moment.
* No questions or concerns
* Not at this time :) I am very happy that I am a Code Fellows student.
